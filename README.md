## And for you programs ?

I use several programs builds from Luke Smith :
* [st](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) my other terminal
* [dmenu](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dmenu) my program launcher
* [mw](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard) a little, my mutt config is broken down for easy editing

The others are listed above.

## Installing those dotfiles

I'm still writing the script to automate the installation. You'll have to add them yourself. 


## Is that all ?

No ! There's informations about everything in every folder and subfolder ! All the config files are commented, and in every subfolder there's a README.md telling you about everything you need to know to use my dotfiles.


## TODO
* [ ] Include screenshots
